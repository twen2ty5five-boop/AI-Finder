## 🚀 Introduction

**AI Finder** is a next-generation Android gallery application that brings the power of Artificial Intelligence directly to your device. 

Forget scrolling through thousands of photos to find that one picture of your dog. **AI Finder** automatically scans your gallery, recognizes objects using **Google ML Kit**, and tags them with relevant keywords—all without a single byte leaving your phone.

Experience the future of photo search. **Fast. Private. Intelligent.**
